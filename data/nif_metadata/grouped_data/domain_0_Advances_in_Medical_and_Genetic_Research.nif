Chicago 1996-08-29  University of Chicago researchers on Thursday said a new gene-therapy technique for treating muscular dystrophy disease had shown progress in laboratory animals .  Word of the findings , to be published in the Oct. 1 issue of the journal \" Human Gene Therapy , \" came in advance of the annual Jerry Lewis Labour Day weekend telethon to raise money for muscular dystrophy research .  Several hurdles must be overcome before the method is used in human trials .  Nevertheless , \" a treatment based on the new strategy .... may have the potential to benefit many patients , \" the University of Chicago Medical Centre said in a release .  Muscular dystrophy is a fatal illness in which the body 's muscle tissue degenerates and is replaced by fat .  Death strikes in early adulthood .  Individuals with the disease have a non-working version of a gene responsible for producing a crucial muscle protein called dystrophin .  In the study at the University 's Institute for Human Gene Therapy , researchers altered a common-cold virus to carry a version of the working dystrophin gene .  The virus , which also was altered to minimise its susceptibility to the immune system , was then injected into the muscle cells of mice bred to lack dystrophin genes .  In the experiment , between 30 to 40 percent of the muscle fibers in one group of mice produced dystrophin for two weeks before diminishing .  Similar results had been obtained previously in test-tube cell cultures , but not in live animals , the university said .  The university said methods are still needed to make enough of the altered virus to treat humans , to further decrease the immune-system response to the virus , and to deliver the virus to human muscle tissue .

PARIS 1996-08-22  Garlic pills may not lower blood cholesterol and studies that show they do may be flawed , French researchers have reported .  A study by a team of doctors at Sorbonne University has found people with high blood cholesterol do not benefit significantly from taking garlic tablets .  The study involved 115 people with high blood cholesterol levels .  They were given 900 milligrams a day of dried garlic powder or placebo tablets . \"  There were no significant differences between the groups receiving garlic and placebo , \" they wrote in the Journal of the Royal College of Physicians .  Those taking part were told to eat a low-fat diet for six weeks before they started taking the pills , and their blood cholesterol measured before and after the six-week period .  The researchers said this would make their findings more accurate .  Several studies have found garlic pills can lower blood pressure and blood cholesterol .  But the Sorbonne team disputed these findings and said either previous trials may have been interpreted incorrectly , those taking part were not given special diets beforehand or the duration of the studies may have been too short .  The six-month trial was funded by the French Federation of Cardiology and Lichtwer Pharma GmbH , which makes Kwai brand garlic tablets .  The study did not address whether whole garlic could affect cholesterol .  -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7950 " .
